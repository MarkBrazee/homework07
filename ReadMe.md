# Project Name: Good ReadMe Generator

### Description of the Project: 

The Good ReadMe Generator is a Node JS file to be used by the developer as they create code or a project and then deposit it in a repository. The file prompts the developer to enter information such as, but not limited to, the project name, description of the project, installation and usage instructions about their code or project. The Generator is a tool to help the developer create a thorough and informative ReadMe file based on best practices.

### Installation instructions: 

Install the Good ReadMe Generator index.js file into your project folder along with the associated package.json file. Next, generate an empty npm project by typing in npm init -y at the project folder command line. Then load the Inquirer node dependency modules into your project folder by typing in npm install inquirer –save. You are now ready to use the Good ReadMe Generator.

### Usage instructions: 

To use the Good ReadMe Generator, open the index.js file within a program for writing code, such as VS Code, navigate to the project folder and type in node index.js in the command prompt. A question will appear in the command prompt asking for information about the project. Answer the question thoroughly and select the ‘enter’ key and another question will appear. Continue to answer all of the questions. Once, all of the questions are answered, a ReadMe file will be created and placed in the project folder.
